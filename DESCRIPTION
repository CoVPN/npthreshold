Description: Implements a nonparametric efficient estimator for the covariate-adjusted threshold-response function for the case of informative outcome missingness, which utilizes machine learning and targeted minimum-loss estimation (TMLE), as described in van der Laan, Zhang, and Gilbert (2023) <DOI:10.1111/biom.13690>
